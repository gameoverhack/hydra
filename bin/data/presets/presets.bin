I am standing on a rise on the Island of Saint Sulpice, above 
the outskirts of Port des Orgues. An unknown threat has taken 
hold of the city. Disaster looms over the capital of this Island 
nation, catching everyone by surprise. I am watching a steady 
stream of people flow from the city streets taking supplies 
and possessions as best they can. --They are refugees from 
an unknown and unverified threat. There has been no official 
order to evacuate. Sweeping blackouts hit the city this 
morning and many areas have been left completely without 
power. Television broadcasts have been down for hours and 
the telephone system here is behaving erratically. A collective 
anxiety that started late this morning is now turning into 
panic and exodus. --Saint Sulpice is known in the Pacific for 
its twin volcanoes, the sleeping organs, from which the port 
city takes its name. Port des Orgues lies behind me at the 
foot of the twins, and indeed an eruption of either of these 
volcanoes would be catastrophic. However, from where I am 
standing there is nothing to suggest that they have suddenly 
become active or pose a threat. The volcanoes have lain 
dormant for time out of mind. --There has been no verified 
communication from local authorities that they have become 
suddenly active. Behind me you can see the city Port des 
Orgues approximately three kilometres from this position. 
*1--As you can see, a steady stream of people are fleeing. 
This historic, beautiful city is emptying itself in anticipation of 
what's to come. They are heading towards us, literally heading 
for the hills I am broadcasting from, using whatever mode of 
transport available, many having to go on foot as congestion 
clogs the arteries out of the city. There are people carrying a 
children, the elderly, supplies and possessions. This is Charles 
Boyd on Saint Sulpice looking down on Port des Orgues where 
people are abandoning the city The stories coming out are 
strange and contradictory - large, or loud noises (I don't have 
any more details at this stage) are are reportedly occurring in 
different parts of the city. It may very well be that what has 
caused the blackouts and accompanying phenomena is yet to 
be identified by anyone. You could describe this situation as 
naked fear and horror, there is no clear context to the threat 
but I can tell you that feelings here are running 
high.--(FX_note)Repeating. I am standing on a rise just 
outside the capital and sole city of Saint Sulpice. The historic, 
beautiful city of Port des Orgues is emptying itself in 
anticipation of what's to come. --As you can see behind me**, 
people are leaving en masse. We don't know what the threat 
is, there have been no official statements from the local 
authorities and, following the blackouts, key services have 
been disrupted or completely down since late this morning. 
With no verified reports of the threat, it seems likely that the 
evacuation is itself one of the primary causes of the confusion 
and lack of communication, as Sulpicois from all walks of life 
abandon the city. What we are experiencing here is the 
confusion and chaos of a disaster unfolding. The fear is that 
the tiny nation of Saint Sulpice is not prepared for this threat, 
and one can expect that the long running consequences of a 
humanitarian or natural disaster would be 
enormous.--Repeating. This is Charles Boyd, I am standing on 
a rise looking down on the outskirts of the City, Port des 
Orgues on the island of Saint Sulpice where an unknown 
threat has taken hold of the city. I flew here two days ago to 
cover a very different story. Like most of the world I was 
largely unaware of this Island's existence, and completely 
unaware that this event was on its way. Saint Sulpice sits 
west of Guam and North of the Marshall Islands at the edge 
of the Pacific. It was once the link in an alternative supply 
line for the French trade routes to Asia, but this island sits 
alone unlike the clusters of Island communities that connect 
the South Pacific. There are no other major population centres 
on the Island and surrounding is the vast isolation of the 
ocean. Help is very far away.   13 Angelus_1.txt 0  21 0 3

25 12 03-02Angelus 3993 --Are you serious? <beay> Can I get some god damn quality 
control on this? Put a marker in there and... let me just 
remind you that this isn't speculative fiction or.. 
god damned fucking national geographic this is happening ok?
(bitch is in your ear telling you you are on).

--What you are watching is live footage events in St Sulpice. 
What is going on here is unclear from the outside. I have just 
had word that early this morning their were reports of minor 
seismic activity*1 and rumours are circulating about a 
possible Tsunami however the Regional Seismological Bureau 
and the Joint Tsunami Warning Center have both played down 
this possibility saying that the tremors were unequivocally too 
small to cause a threat. 

--What you are seeing behind me is a mass evacuation from 
the little known city of Port des Orgues. Refugees are fleeing 
from an unknown and unverified threat. There has been no 
official order to evacuate. Local television broadcasts have 
been down for hours and the telephone system here is 
behaving erratically. It seems a collective panic that started 
late this morning is now turning into spontaneous exodus. 
This is Charles Boyd in Saint Sulpice. 

--The situation here is rapidly unfolding. I am positioned in 
the foothills above the city. What you can see in the 
foreground is a brief stretch of lowland plains crossed by the 
roads connecting the outskirts of the city with the port and 
the rest of the island. The flow of traffic today is all one way 
and completely out of character for this beautiful and slow 
paced Island. The majority of people are heading into the 
foothills that stand opposite the giant twin volcanoes. 

They are heading straight towards where I am positioned and 
the first cars of the congested procession have passed me in 
the last 30 minutes. As you can see behind me many people 
are leaving the city on foot. These are very dramatic scenes 
here.*2#2 I have just been told that talk of incredibly strange 
and disquieting noises reported to be almost industrial 
sounding have been heard again in parts of the city. I have 
no idea what to make of this information other than to say 
that I have a terrible sense of foreboding. The day is 
lengthening and this crisis continues. All these people leaving 
the city are going to be in darkness in a few hours and 
having to establish shelters. We are talking about a lot of 
people a whole city evacuated into any safe space they can 
find. 

--Beyond the evacuation lines you can see the historic city 
itself. Saint Sulpice was once a stepping stone of colonial 
trade routes. The clump of squat ornately decorated towers 
mark the centre of Saint Sulpice built during a tumultuous 
period of colonial industry where the Island changed hands 
amongst rival naval flotillas until finally the French fortified 
and consolidated their position here. The stores of sulphur 
abundant in the volcanic substrata of the Island were a 
precious resource to the colonial effort. Amongst other uses in 
early industry sulphur was a vital catalytic component of gun 
powder. However the mineral has become largely redundant in 
contemporary industry and Saint Sulpice has struggled for 
generations to replace mining with a substitute commodity. 

--The people that live here today are descended from 
migrants out of Micronesia and Polynesia enslaved peoples out 
of Africa and mostly French colonists. The unique vital culture 
here is very independent by necessity. The Island has a 
history of short term industry as its economic value waxes 
and wanes. As you can see from afar the structures are old 
most built cheaply** during the long years of economic 
decline and likely to be very vulnerable if a natural disaster 
should prove to be the cause of this event. It is not a place 
that has the reserves to cope with vast structural damage. 
Being remote and economically weak the fall out here could 
be a catalyst for an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.   13 Angelus_2.txt 0  176 0 3

This is Charles Boyd. I am standing on a rise in Saint Sulpice, 
where a dramatic evacuation of the capital city continues 
while the threat remains officially unverified. As you can see, 
a steady stream of refugees are heading straight past my 
position in the foothills here. The obvious consideration are 
the volcanoes that dwarf the city, however, these giants have 
been inactive for centuries and appear, at least from the 
outside, to remain that way. There are many rumours and 
stories circulating but as yet we have no confirmation. What 
is very real is the evacuation you are watching. The scenes 
here are absolutely unprecedented and, though unexplained, I 
have no doubt that the evacuation is warranted. Stay with us 
as events unfold.--(begin to be unsteady). This is Charles

In the last few minutes a light smoke or vapourous substance 
has become visible over the city. At this point we are waiting 
on verification of the cause. Without wanting to add to the 
spread of misinformation I can say that in addition to the fear 
of a volcanic eruption, speculation of political unrest and 
conflict is circulating as is the possibility of some kind of 
epidemic.--As yet, neither of these possibilities have been tied 
to the strange haze that has appeared above the city. In 
short, we don't know what is happening. We seem to be 
inside an unfolding disaster. It is possible that two 
independent developments have coincided. While the situation 
remains unclear, the meagre infrastructure and supply of 
resources to this part of the world suggest that whatever is 
going on, it is likely to escalate very rapidly and result in 
disastrous outcomes. This is Charles Boyd in Saint

this is from The Financial Times, an Editorial by George 
Whitehead

Something is happening on the internet. If you haven't 
noticed, there are new terms floating about like 'internet 
crazies' and, my favourite - because it is so clinical sounding, 
'performative psychosis'. These terms predominantly refer to 
video and social media freaks who put bizarre, often self 
depricating, deeply compulsive videos of themselves out into 
the public domain. They do this aggressively and with verve.

(Allison begins compulsive action)

When the terrible geyser disaster in Saint Sulpice occurred it 
seemed to act as a catalyst or trigger for more people to get 
'performatively psychotic'. Some person might have started it. 
Perhaps a group of nutters symbiotically did it at the same 
time, we will likely never know the truth of this. They started 
to live stream themselves using their webcams, except they 
weren't doing anything - not at first. The 'online phenomena' 
as it has been referred, began with the act of streaming 
themselves watching Charles Boyd's live coverage from Saint 
Sulpice.

(Michelle)

Bear in mind that Charles Boyd was the only western news 
journalist on that Island. He was the only man in possession 
of a satellite phone at the site of one of the most extreme 
and bizarre humanitarian disasters ever witnessed. His 
coverage achieved higher ratings than any other singular 
stream of live broadcast (because other disasters or major 
live media events have always had more than one camera 
man in attendence). So if you missed it, I hope you are 
comfortable under that rock. But these internet crazies, they 
decided that what we really needed in that moment, and what 
the people in Saint Sulpice needed, was thousands of people 
videoing themselves watching it. There is something very 
misguided about the logic of the internet. And for all those 
who believe the web is humanity's alter ego or the digital 
manifestation of our collective consciousness, then I say to 
you I think we are in for a lot of trouble. Now this 'online 
movement' has grown and as the story dissipates these 
people keep the flame alive by performing odes to Saint 
Sulpice or Charles Boyd or whoever in their bedrooms.

(Allison picks up final text)

Others perform re-enactments of the events, or artistic 
renderings of their emotional responses. I have heard they 
have even started to read commentaries and newspaper 
articles to video. As I write this I wonder if I am putting 
words into some crazy persons mouth. Heaven forbid.

HOST
Now we speak live via sattelite link with Margeret Bell, the 
Australian activist currently under house arrest in Saint 
Sulpice. Bell travelled to the Island nation shortly after the 
disaster, tonight we hear her story.

Welcome Margeret. <nod -inaudible hello from Bell> How are 
your conditions in Saint Sulpice and what can you tell us 
about them?
BELL
I'm ok. I'm in what's being called house arrest. <beat> I'm 
being held in an administration building the police have taken 
over, so it's not actually a house. I'm just not in the prison 
with everyone else. 
HOST
And this has been negotiated by the Australian consul?
BELL
I don't want to speak about whatever negotiations might be 
happening.
HOST
Ok, Can you explain how you came to Saint Sulpice and what 
your involvement was with  video blog group Songs of the 
Suffering Channel'?
BELL
Sufferimg Channel was part of an online reaction to the 
disaster. I don't know if it is still happening. First it started as 
people streaming themselves watching the live disaster feed.
HOST
So bloggers used their webcams to broadcast their own faces 
as they watched the disaster on their computer screens and 
posted this to facebook and social media?
BELL
Yes. And then after that people began to hold online vigils 
and create actions calling for support for Saint Sulpice.
HOST
But it was very bizaare wasn't it. Some of these actions.
BELL
Some of it wasn't very clear.
HOST
What was the group hoping to achieve?
BELL
It changed, people were trying to help in different ways. 
HOST
And a number of people involved became mentally unstable in 
the course of their invovlement with the online group?
BELL
Yes. 
HOST
Your partner became unwell whilst she was a prominent 
blogger on the Suffering Channel didn't she?
BELL
Yes.<silence>
HOST
And it was at that time that you left to go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
Mm. <silence>
HOST
Why did you go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
At the time I felt like I needed to do something real. I wanted 
to see what was happening for myself and help if I could.
HOST
How did you manage to get there?
BELL
I booked a holiday package to Palau and then I paid for a 
deep sea fishing boat to take me across to Saint Sulpice. 
HOST
That is a pretty amazing route to take. Why did you need to 
go to the Island so desperately?
BELL
I just thought it was important. It was in the front of my 
mind all the time. I didn't want to watch it on television. So I 
decied to go.
HOST 
Was it a reaction to your partners breakdown and the 
Suffering Channel movement?
BELL
No. It was happening. But it didn't decide it for me. I made a 
decision. I wouldn't call it a reaction. *
HOST
How did you end up up at the Stadium - the Stade de 
l'Aquitaine?
BELL
I volunteered with a local group that was helping to create 
more long-term shelters in the hills above Port des Orgue. 
HOST
Why did they trust you?
BELL
I bent my story a little. I told them I was a traveller and 
insinuated I had been on Palau went it happened. That I had 
decided to come and help if I could. They were very 
welcoming and brought me in straight away. Working with 
Sulpicois I heard about the Stade' first. 
HOST
And you went there?
BELL
Many of the people I was working with wanted to go and 
because so many displaced people were moving that way they 
knew our help would be needed too.
HOST
And it was there that developments led to your arrest along 
with many local people. I will ask you about the events at the
stadium I understand there are limitations as to what you can
say in your current circumstances but first how do you 
respond
to the statements by the spokesperson for the Deparment of

Foriegn Affairs and Trade and I qoute Australian citizens that 
involve themselves in the political affairs of another country 
cannot expect the Australian Government to countermand 
criminal charges that are an outcome of such interference.

We strongly advise Australian's abroad to respect the political 
soveriegnty of foriegn nations. How do those comments make 
you feel?

BELL

your conditions in Saint Sulpice and what can you tell us 
about them?
BELL
I'm ok. I'm in what's being called house arrest. <beat> I'm 
being held in an administration building the police have taken 
over, so it's not actually a house. I'm just not in the prison 
with everyone else. 
HOST
And this has been negotiated by the Australian consul?
BELL
I don't want to speak about whatever negotiations might be 
happening.
HOST
Ok, Can you explain how you came to Saint Sulpice and what 
your involvement was with  video blog group Songs of the 
Suffering Channel'?
BELL
Sufferimg Channel was part of an online reaction to the 
disaster. I don't know if it is still happening. First it started as 
people streaming themselves watching the live disaster feed.
HOST
So bloggers used their webcams to broadcast their own faces 
as they watched the disaster on their computer screens and 
posted this to facebook and social media?
BELL
Yes. And then after that people began to hold online vigils 
and create actions calling for support for Saint Sulpice.
HOST
But it was very bizaare wasn't it. Some of these actions.
BELL
Some of it wasn't very clear.
HOST
What was the group hoping to achieve?
BELL
It changed, people were trying to help in different ways. 
HOST
And a number of people involved became mentally unstable in 
the course of their invovlement with the online group?
BELL
Yes. 
HOST
Your partner became unwell whilst she was a prominent 
blogger on the Suffering Channel didn't she?
BELL
Yes.<silence>
HOST
And it was at that time that you left to go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
Mm. <silence>
HOST
Why did you go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
At the time I felt like I needed to do something real. I wanted 
to see what was happening for myself and help if I could.
HOST
How did you manage to get there?
BELL
I booked a holiday package to Palau and then I paid for a 
deep sea fishing boat to take me across to Saint Sulpice. 
HOST
That is a pretty amazing route to take. Why did you need to 
go to the Island so desperately?
BELL
I just thought it was important. It was in the front of my 
mind all the time. I didn't want to watch it on television. So I 
decied to go.
HOST 
Was it a reaction to your partners breakdown and the 
Suffering Channel movement?
BELL
No. It was happening. But it didn't decide it for me. I made a 
decision. I wouldn't call it a reaction. *
HOST
How did you end up up at the Stadium - the Stade de 
l'Aquitaine?
BELL
I volunteered with a local group that was helping to create 
more long-term shelters in the hills above Port des Orgue. 
HOST
Why did they trust you?
BELL
I bent my story a little. I told them I was a traveller and 
insinuated I had been on Palau went it happened. That I had 
decided to come and help if I could. They were very 
welcoming and brought me in straight away. Working with 
Sulpicois I heard about the Stade' first. 
HOST
And you went there?
BELL
Many of the people I was working with wanted to go and 
because so many displaced people were moving that way they 
knew our help would be needed too.
HOST
And it was there that developments led to your arrest along 
with many local people. I will ask you about the events at the
stadium I understand there are limitations as to what you can
say in your current circumstances but first how do you 
respond
to the statements by the spokesperson for the Deparment of

Foriegn Affairs and Trade and I qoute Australian citizens that 
involve themselves in the political affairs of another country 
cannot expect the Australian Government to countermand 
criminal charges that are an outcome of such interference.

We strongly advise Australian's abroad to respect the political 
soveriegnty of foriegn nations. How do those comments make 
you feel?

BELL
<Wry smile.>

I looked around
(repeat)
for debris in the kitchen,
(repeat)
in the bathroom,
(repeat)
in my bed.
(repeat)
But my home is a sanctuary.
(repeat)
So I went out into the street
(repeat)
and I looked for pieces
(repeat)
and fragments
(repeat)
I found broken things in the park
(repeat)
and a dead cat in a vacant block
(repeat)
I found a shoe
(repeat)
and lots of rubbish
(repeat)
and many sticks and rocks
(repeat)
I brought them all home in a garbage bag
(repeat)
I spread it all out on the floor
(repeat)
And I lay in my disaster.

I have fractured into pieces -
(repeat)
emotionally speaking.
(repeat)
I feel regret for things I didn’t do.
(repeat)
Or if I did, I wasn’t aware of doing them.
(repeat)
I feel paranoid and anxious.
(repeat)
And the only time
(repeat)
I’ve ever felt like this before
(repeat)
is when I’ve been hung over.
(repeat)
Now I lie amongst dirt and  mud.
(repeat)
In a garden of destroyed things.
(repeat)
And the debris of my body.
(repeat)
And I rewatch the footage.

(In unison)
In each watching, 
the mis en scene of the disaster
reveals new images, 
first one apparition,
and then another.

The man on the scene,
our surrogate, transforms.
From his shoulders emerge stria of mist -
that un-cloud of what must have been
stinking sulphurous vapuor,
becomes wings. His wings.
They tear on the wind, away from his shoulders,
then reappear again.

As I review the scene, 
on, again, further,
the mist becomes dense and thick,
like yellow milk in the sky.
Pixels and artefacts in the video
wink out at me, 
signalling the metamorphosis,
and from these plumes, 
in the filigree of death,
a greater apparition appears.
The stinking angel.
It dwarfs the human in the frame,
but resonates with him. 
The person stands,
opening and closing his mouth, 
and the angel rises,
Oh what a smell!
the angel floats above the city,
above the journalist, 
right before the cataclysm breaks.

(Deb and Michelle)
and I think on angels,
about humans with wings,
agents of divine intervention,
elevated by mass worship,
elevated by numbers,
by statistical belief.
Is my ideation,
my vision,
my hope,
an angel of deliverance
or death or something else?
This is my crisis.



How can I help?
