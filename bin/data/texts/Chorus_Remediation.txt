Something is happening on the internet. If you haven't noticed, there are new terms floating about like 'internet crazies' and, my favourite - because it is so clinical sounding, 'performative psychosis'. These terms predominantly refer to video and social media freaks who put bizarre, often self depricating, deeply compulsive videos of themselves out into the public domain. They do this aggressively and with verve.

When the terrible geyser disaster in Saint Sulpice occurred it seemed to act as a catalyst or trigger for more people to get 'performatively psychotic'. Some person might have started it. Perhaps a group of nutters symbiotically did it at the same time, we will likely never know the truth of this. They started to live stream themselves using their webcams, except they weren't doing anything - not at first. The 'online phenomena' as it has been referred, began with the act of streaming themselves watching Charles Boyd's live coverage from Saint Sulpice.

Bear in mind that Charles Boyd was the only western news journalist on that Island. He was the only man in possession of a satellite phone at the site of one of the most extreme and bizarre humanitarian disasters ever witnessed. His coverage achieved higher ratings than any other singular stream of live broadcast (because other disasters or major live media events have always had more than one camera man in attendence). So if you missed it, I hope you are comfortable under that rock. But these internet crazies, they decided that what we really needed in that moment, and what the people in Saint Sulpice needed, was thousands of people videoing themselves watching it. There is something very misguided about the logic of the internet. And for all those who believe the web is humanity's alter ego or the digital manifestation of our collective consciousness, then I say to you I think we are in for a lot of trouble. Now this 'online movement' has grown and as the story dissipates these people keep the flame alive by performing odes to Saint Sulpice or Charles Boyd or whoever in their bedrooms.

(Allison picks up final text)

Others perform re-enactments of the events, or artistic renderings of their emotional responses. I have heard they have even started to read commentaries and newspaper articles to video. As I write this I wonder if I am putting words into some crazy persons mouth. Heaven forbid.
