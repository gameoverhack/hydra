--(To Catherine)Are you hearing this? I could ad lib my own horseshit quite adequately! What the fuck. (To earpiece) is anyone fact checking this?**

(listen in ear.)

Wait. when Jule says " this is broadcast history, so close" he Rip bitch out of ear.)

This is Charles Boyd. I am standing on a rise in Saint Sulpice, where a dramatic evacuation of the capital city continues while the threat remains officially unverified. As you can see, a steady stream of refugees are heading straight past my position in the foothills here. The obvious consideration are the volcanoes that dwarf the city, however, these giants have been inactive for centuries and appear, at least from the outside, to remain that way. There are many rumours and stories circulating but as yet we have no confirmation. What is very real is the evacuation you are watching. The scenes here are absolutely unprecedented and, though unexplained, I have no doubt that the evacuation is warranted. Stay with us as events unfold.--(begin to be unsteady).

At this point we are waiting on verification of the cause. Without wanting to add to the spread of misinformation I can say that in addition to the fear of a volcanic eruption, speculation of political unrest and conflict is circulating as is the possibility of some kind of epidemic.--As yet, neither of these possibilities have been tied to the strange haze that has appeared above the city. In short, we don't know what is happening. We seem to be inside an unfolding disaster. It is possible that two independent developments have coincided. While the situation remains unclear, the meagre infrastructure and supply of resources to this part of the world suggest that whatever is going on, it is likely to escalate very rapidly and result in disastrous outcomes. This is Charles Boyd in Saint Sulpice.--As you can see the people here are taking the threat very seriously.
