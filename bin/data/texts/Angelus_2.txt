--Are you serious? <beay> Can I get some god damn quality control on this? Put a marker in there and... let me just remind you that this isn't speculative fiction or.. 
god damned fucking national geographic this is happening ok?
(bitch is in your ear telling you you are on).

--What you are watching is live footage events in St Sulpice. What is going on here is unclear from the outside. I have just had word that early this morning their were reports of minor seismic activity*1 and rumours are circulating about a possible Tsunami however the Regional Seismological Bureau and the Joint Tsunami Warning Center have both played down this possibility saying that the tremors were unequivocally too small to cause a threat. 

--What you are seeing behind me is a mass evacuation from the little known city of Port des Orgues. Refugees are fleeing from an unknown and unverified threat. There has been no official order to evacuate. Local television broadcasts have been down for hours and the telephone system here is behaving erratically. It seems a collective panic that started late this morning is now turning into spontaneous exodus. This is Charles Boyd in Saint Sulpice. 

--The situation here is rapidly unfolding. I am positioned in the foothills above the city. What you can see in the foreground is a brief stretch of lowland plains crossed by the roads connecting the outskirts of the city with the port and the rest of the island. The flow of traffic today is all one way and completely out of character for this beautiful and slow paced Island. The majority of people are heading into the foothills that stand opposite the giant twin volcanoes. 

They are heading straight towards where I am positioned and the first cars of the congested procession have passed me in the last 30 minutes. As you can see behind me many people are leaving the city on foot. These are very dramatic scenes here.*2#2 I have just been told that talk of incredibly strange and disquieting noises reported to be almost industrial sounding have been heard again in parts of the city. I have no idea what to make of this information other than to say that I have a terrible sense of foreboding. The day is lengthening and this crisis continues. All these people leaving the city are going to be in darkness in a few hours and having to establish shelters. We are talking about a lot of people a whole city evacuated into any safe space they can find. 

--Beyond the evacuation lines you can see the historic city itself. Saint Sulpice was once a stepping stone of colonial trade routes. The clump of squat ornately decorated towers mark the centre of Saint Sulpice built during a tumultuous period of colonial industry where the Island changed hands amongst rival naval flotillas until finally the French fortified and consolidated their position here. The stores of sulphur abundant in the volcanic substrata of the Island were a precious resource to the colonial effort. Amongst other uses in early industry sulphur was a vital catalytic component of gun powder. However the mineral has become largely redundant in contemporary industry and Saint Sulpice has struggled for generations to replace mining with a substitute commodity. 

--The people that live here today are descended from migrants out of Micronesia and Polynesia enslaved peoples out of Africa and mostly French colonists. The unique vital culture here is very independent by necessity. The Island has a history of short term industry as its economic value waxes and wanes. As you can see from afar the structures are old most built cheaply** during the long years of economic decline and likely to be very vulnerable if a natural disaster should prove to be the cause of this event. It is not a place that has the reserves to cope with vast structural damage. Being remote and economically weak the fall out here could be a catalyst for an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.
