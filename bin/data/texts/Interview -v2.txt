HOST
Now we speak live via sattelite link with Margeret Bell, the Australian activist currently under house arrest in Saint Sulpice. Bell travelled to the Island nation shortly after the disaster, tonight we hear her story.

Welcome Margeret. <nod -inaudible hello from Bell> How are your conditions in Saint Sulpice and what can you tell us about them?
BELL
I'm ok. I'm in what's being called house arrest. <beat> I'm being held in an administration building the police have taken over, so it's not actually a house. I'm just not in the prison with everyone else. 
HOST
And this has been negotiated by the Australian consul?
BELL
I don't want to speak about whatever negotiations might be happening.
HOST
Ok, Can you explain how you came to Saint Sulpice and what your involvement was with  video blog group Songs of the Suffering Channel'?
BELL
Sufferimg Channel was part of an online reaction to the disaster. I don't know if it is still happening. First it started as people streaming themselves watching the live disaster feed.
HOST
So bloggers used their webcams to broadcast their own faces as they watched the disaster on their computer screens and posted this to facebook and social media?
BELL
Yes. And then after that people began to hold online vigils and create actions calling for support for Saint Sulpice.
HOST
But it was very bizaare wasn't it. Some of these actions.
BELL
Some of it wasn't very clear.
HOST
What was the group hoping to achieve?
BELL
It changed, people were trying to help in different ways. 
HOST
And a number of people involved became mentally unstable in the course of their invovlement with the online group?
BELL
Yes. 
HOST
Your partner became unwell whilst she was a prominent blogger on the Suffering Channel didn't she?
BELL
Yes.<silence>
HOST
And it was at that time that you left to go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
Mm. <silence>
HOST
Why did you go to Saint Sulpice?
BELL
At the time I felt like I needed to do something real. I wanted to see what was happening for myself and help if I could.
HOST
How did you manage to get there?
BELL
I booked a holiday package to Palau and then I paid for a deep sea fishing boat to take me across to Saint Sulpice. 
HOST
That is a pretty amazing route to take. Why did you need to go to the Island so desperately?
BELL
I just thought it was important. It was in the front of my mind all the time. I didn't want to watch it on television. So I decied to go.
HOST 
Was it a reaction to your partners breakdown and the Suffering Channel movement?
BELL
No. It was happening. But it didn't decide it for me. I made a decision. I wouldn't call it a reaction. *
HOST
How did you end up up at the Stadium - the Stade de l'Aquitaine?
BELL
I volunteered with a local group that was helping to create more long-term shelters in the hills above Port des Orgue. 
HOST
Why did they trust you?
BELL
I bent my story a little. I told them I was a traveller and insinuated I had been on Palau went it happened. That I had decided to come and help if I could. They were very welcoming and brought me in straight away. Working with Sulpicois I heard about the Stade' first. 
HOST
And you went there?
BELL
Many of the people I was working with wanted to go and because so many displaced people were moving that way they knew our help would be needed too.
HOST
And it was there that developments led to your arrest along with many local people. I will ask you about the events at the
stadium I understand there are limitations as to what you can
say in your current circumstances but first how do you respond
to the statements by the spokesperson for the Deparment of

Foriegn Affairs and Trade and I qoute Australian citizens that involve themselves in the political affairs of another country cannot expect the Australian Government to countermand criminal charges that are an outcome of such interference.

We strongly advise Australian's abroad to respect the political soveriegnty of foriegn nations. How do those comments make you feel?

BELL
<Wry smile.>
