Without wanting to speculate or compound the feeling here it is obvious that at least some of the rumours circulating must have some truth to them. The mist substance is now far more apparent over the city (text has stopped - voices. wait for 'straight down' text starts up again).… Oh... We're getting reports now! yes, behind me a building has just dropped from the city skyline and a cloud of dust can be seen rising right up above where it was just standing.*4#4 --This is Charles Boyd from Saint Sulpice where just behind me one of the larger buildings has just disappeared from the city skyline. Repeating, I am standing on a rise outside the city of Port des Orgues on the Island nation of Saint Sulpice where a building has just dropped out of the city skyline. There was a force from below that shot up and out of the building that looked like a fountain of dust and debris and water coming with it and when all that material came back down out of the air the building vanished. It is just not there. A force shot out and then pulled the building back down.. *5 ------ These are live images from Saint Sulpice where a building has just dropped out of view after an explosion. A great force from below has been seen, shooting up and through the building, resembling a fountain of debris and water. And as all this material fell back down from the air the building disappeared. MORE MORE. These images ARE Live. There was some kind of explosion just now in the city of Port Des Orgue. (.. waiting for more text - LOOK FOR LINES TO REPEAT AS THEY SCROLL BYE WITH YOUR EYES AND SAY SOME). --Another… (break in the text) The people nearest the city are running. Another explosion has just occurred in the city. It looked to come out of a park area, you can see what looks like water still pouring out into the air. Repeating there has been a second type of explosion event in the city of Port des Orgues. The first occurred only minutes ago where a building dropped out of the city's silhouette and now we've just seen a second powerful force jettison up into the air from a park area in the city and there is still water and debris flying up in spurts. It looks as though there must be some involvement of the water supply beneath the city... There is a vapour or gas enveloping the city now. What we thought was a mist or gas earlier is now far more present above the city and... The people are abandoning their vehicles they are running away from the city, these are terrible scenes. It looked as though there were still many people leaving the city when these explosions happened. Behind me you can see the city of Port des Orgues in chaos as a series of explosions or implosions are occurring across the city. Behind me the citizens of Saint Sulpice are desperately making their way into the foothills where I am positioned. We don't know what is happening or if we are safe here. This is Charles Boyd in Saint Sulpice outside the city of Port des Orgues. I am going to move up the hillside now because this situation is very unstable. (break). --This is Charles Boyd in Saint Sulpice outside the city of Port des Orgues. I am going to move up the hillside now because this situation is very unstable. Move now. Charlie, cut. Move. Move. END OF BROADCAST. END OF BROADCAST.
