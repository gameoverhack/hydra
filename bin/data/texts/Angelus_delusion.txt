I looked around
(repeat)
for debris in the kitchen,
(repeat)
in the bathroom,
(repeat)
in my bed.
(repeat)
But my home is a sanctuary.
(repeat)
So I went out into the street
(repeat)
and I looked for pieces
(repeat)
and fragments
(repeat)
I found broken things in the park
(repeat)
and a dead cat in a vacant block
(repeat)
I found a shoe
(repeat)
and lots of rubbish
(repeat)
and many sticks and rocks
(repeat)
I brought them all home in a garbage bag
(repeat)
I spread it all out on the floor
(repeat)
And I lay in my disaster.

I have fractured into pieces -
(repeat)
emotionally speaking.
(repeat)
I feel regret for things I didn’t do.
(repeat)
Or if I did, I wasn’t aware of doing them.
(repeat)
I feel paranoid and anxious.
(repeat)
And the only time
(repeat)
I’ve ever felt like this before
(repeat)
is when I’ve been hung over.
(repeat)
Now I lie amongst dirt and  mud.
(repeat)
In a garden of destroyed things.
(repeat)
And the debris of my body.
(repeat)
And I rewatch the footage.

(In unison)
In each watching, 
the mis en scene of the disaster
reveals new images, 
first one apparition,
and then another.

The man on the scene,
our surrogate, transforms.
From his shoulders emerge stria of mist -
that un-cloud of what must have been
stinking sulphurous vapuor,
becomes wings. His wings.
They tear on the wind, away from his shoulders,
then reappear again.

As I review the scene, 
on, again, further,
the mist becomes dense and thick,
like yellow milk in the sky.
Pixels and artefacts in the video
wink out at me, 
signalling the metamorphosis,
and from these plumes, 
in the filigree of death,
a greater apparition appears.
The stinking angel.
It dwarfs the human in the frame,
but resonates with him. 
The person stands,
opening and closing his mouth, 
and the angel rises,
Oh what a smell!
the angel floats above the city,
above the journalist, 
right before the cataclysm breaks.

(Deb and Michelle)
and I think on angels,
about humans with wings,
agents of divine intervention,
elevated by mass worship,
elevated by numbers,
by statistical belief.
Is my ideation,
my vision,
my hope,
an angel of deliverance
or death or something else?
This is my crisis.



How can I help?
