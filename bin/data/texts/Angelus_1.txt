I am standing on a rise on the Island of Saint Sulpice, above the outskirts of Port des Orgues. An unknown threat has taken hold of the city. Disaster looms over the capital of this Island nation, catching everyone by surprise. I am watching a steady stream of people flow from the city streets taking supplies and possessions as best they can. --They are refugees from an unknown and unverified threat. There has been no official order to evacuate. Sweeping blackouts hit the city this morning and many areas have been left completely without power. Television broadcasts have been down for hours and the telephone system here is behaving erratically. A collective anxiety that started late this morning is now turning into panic and exodus. --Saint Sulpice is known in the Pacific for its twin volcanoes, the sleeping organs, from which the port city takes its name. Port des Orgues lies behind me at the foot of the twins, and indeed an eruption of either of these volcanoes would be catastrophic. However, from where I am standing there is nothing to suggest that they have suddenly become active or pose a threat. The volcanoes have lain dormant for time out of mind. --There has been no verified communication from local authorities that they have become suddenly active. Behind me you can see the city Port des Orgues approximately three kilometres from this position. *1--As you can see, a steady stream of people are fleeing. This historic, beautiful city is emptying itself in anticipation of what's to come. They are heading towards us, literally heading for the hills I am broadcasting from, using whatever mode of transport available, many having to go on foot as congestion clogs the arteries out of the city. There are people carrying a children, the elderly, supplies and possessions. This is Charles Boyd on Saint Sulpice looking down on Port des Orgues where people are abandoning the city The stories coming out are strange and contradictory - large, or loud noises (I don't have any more details at this stage) are are reportedly occurring in different parts of the city. It may very well be that what has caused the blackouts and accompanying phenomena is yet to be identified by anyone. You could describe this situation as naked fear and horror, there is no clear context to the threat but I can tell you that feelings here are running high.--(FX_note)Repeating. I am standing on a rise just outside the capital and sole city of Saint Sulpice. The historic, beautiful city of Port des Orgues is emptying itself in anticipation of what's to come. --As you can see behind me**, people are leaving en masse. We don't know what the threat is, there have been no official statements from the local authorities and, following the blackouts, key services have been disrupted or completely down since late this morning. With no verified reports of the threat, it seems likely that the evacuation is itself one of the primary causes of the confusion and lack of communication, as Sulpicois from all walks of life abandon the city. What we are experiencing here is the confusion and chaos of a disaster unfolding. The fear is that the tiny nation of Saint Sulpice is not prepared for this threat, and one can expect that the long running consequences of a humanitarian or natural disaster would be enormous.--Repeating. This is Charles Boyd, I am standing on a rise looking down on the outskirts of the City, Port des Orgues on the island of Saint Sulpice where an unknown threat has taken hold of the city. I flew here two days ago to cover a very different story. Like most of the world I was largely unaware of this Island's existence, and completely unaware that this event was on its way. Saint Sulpice sits west of Guam and North of the Marshall Islands at the edge of the Pacific. It was once the link in an alternative supply line for the French trade routes to Asia, but this island sits alone unlike the clusters of Island communities that connect the South Pacific. There are no other major population centres on the Island and surrounding is the vast isolation of the ocean. Help is very far away.
